Multiple Sequence Alignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clustal Omega protein alignment
===============================

We are going to use the clustal omega program to analyze some homologous proteins to the human frataxin in :download:`mammals <../static/multiple/frataxin_mamiferos.fasta>`.

You can use clustal `omega <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/>`_ in the ebi server.
There are also on-line servers that create clustalw alignments and you can read its 

Create an alignment check the result.
Is there any problem?

What would happen if we remove the most dissimilar sequences
------------------------------------------------------------

Redo the analysis only with the :download:`closest mammals <../static/multiple/frataxin_mamiferos_cercanos.fasta>` and compare the result with the previous one.

What would happen with more dissimilar sequences
------------------------------------------------

Try to do the alignment with more different :download:`sequences <../static/multiple/frataxin_prot.fasta>`.

T-Coffee
--------

Compare the result with the one given by `T-Coffee <http://tcoffee.crg.cat/apps/tcoffee/do:regular>`_

Once you have the result you can use the TCS tool in the same server to get an idea of which sites are reliable which are not.

Conserved domains
-----------------

Compare the result with the `domain <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cddsrv.cgi?uid=29607>`_ stored in NCBI for the frataxin.

Is this domain similar to any of our alignments?

DNA sequence alignment
======================

We can also align DNA sequences.
This is useful to do phylogenetic analysis and to look for mutations in the sequences.
We are going to look for the SNPs in the :download:`CT099 <../static/multiple/seq_dna.fasta>` gene of *Lycopersicum pimpinellifolium*. Align them using `MAFFT <http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/mafft/>`_.

Take a look at the guide tree. Is this a reliable phylogenetic tree?
