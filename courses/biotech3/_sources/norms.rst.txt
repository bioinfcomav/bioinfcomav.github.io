Methodology
===========

This bioinformatics introduction will deal mainly with DNA and protein sequence analysis.
Our aim is to provide a practical overview of the subject that will enable the student to carry out its own basic sequence analyses once the course is over.

Each unit will be divided in:


* A short theoretical introduction
* Some guided practice
* Some exercises to be carried out by the student

The introduction will start with the biological basis for the analysis and a shallow overview to the main algorithms used.
The planning and interpretation of the results of the analysis will be the main focus.
During the practical classes the analysis explained in the theoretical classes will be carried out.

The course web site will be updated throughout the course.

Tutoring
--------

You should make an appointment by email for tutoring.

Course evaluation
=================


* 
  2 open answer exams (40% each)
