Problem: Look for a sequence in a database
	- species assignment
	- function annotation
	- phylogeny

We can look by aligning our query to every sequence in the database

query vs subject
	query our sequence
	subject database

SW problem speed

Blast family of related algorithms
	one of the most used algorithms

algorithm vs implementation
	NCBI implementation

Produces local alignments

Based on words (k-tuples or kmers)

Hash algorithm

Blast algorithm
	Database
		kmers/words are indexed
	Look for the query words in the index
	Regions with kmers similars to query are seeds
	Local alignments are build from seeds

Advantages
	It is fast (good) (although there are faster algorithms)
	Blast looks by default forward and reverse complementary

limitations:
	Not as sensible SW
		Problem if we don't find seeds
		a very distant seq won't be found
		Smaller kmers more sensitive, but slower and bigger DBs
	Alignments not as polished as SW

HSPs
	High Scoring Pair
	A query and a subject might have several HSPs

A subject is a hit

Family:
	megablast
	blastn, blastp, blastx, tblastx

The blast pairwise alignment is one of the most used in practice
It is convinient:
	- easily available in the web
	- It does two strand
	- It does a dot plot and text alignment

evalue
	Are the alignments statistically significative?
	Any two sequences will produce an alignment, even random sequences
	Create aligments with random sequences
	Create score histograms
	e-value (expect) number of hits that one expect to see by chance

Iterative algorithms

PSI-BLAST
	Iterative to look for very distant sequences
	Position-Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSM).
	patterns found in several sequences
	frequency for each residue in every position
