Sequences are similar

alignment:
	- phylogeny
	- function: protein, promoter
	- mutations
	- mRNA

They are similar because they come from a common ancestor

Homologous/analogous

Similarity

How do we know if two sequences are homologous?

Homologous residues

Residue: nucleotide or aminoacid

Alignment objetive, align residues:
	- homologous
	- same function

The more time passes the more mutations


Gaps complicate the alignment

gaps: insertions or deletions

Many possible alignments


DOTPLOT

The alignment is a diagonal

Deletion, tandem, reverse and complement, inversion

Problems with the strands

Nice to study structure

Genomic level dotplots

How is it possible that the genomic dotplot works taking into account the strands?

It shows alternative alignments

They do not show the residues aligned

Dotplot Gene structure practice example

SENTITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY

dotplot:
	- threshold influence
	- high threshold:
		- few false signals
		- we might lose true signals
	- low threshold:
		- true signals are detected
		- more false signals

Examples:
	- HIV infection
	- listeriosis contamination

kinds of signals:
	- true positives,
        - true negatives,
	- false positives,
	- false negatives

sensitivity: 
	- Proportion of true positives that we are recovering
	- called positives / real positives

specificity:
	- Proportion of true negatives that we are recovering
	- called negatives / real negatives

example with elisa or PCR gel

stringent                 tolerant
threshold                 threshold
    |                        |
ind1  ind2  ind3  ind4  ind5  ind6 ind7
++++  ++    +     
++++  ++++  ++++  ++++  ++    +

stringent threshold:
	- low sensitivity:
		- We miss true positives
		- many true positives are classified as negative
		- many false negatives
	- high specificity:
		- We get most true negatives
		- many true negatives are detected as negative
		- few false positives
tolerant threshold:
	- high sentitivity:
		- We get most true positives
		- many true positives are classified as positive
		- few false negatives
	- low specificity:
		- We get many true negatives as positives
		- many false positives

Alternative approach:
	- give probability of positive and negative (1 - positive)

TEXT PAIRWISE ALIGNMENT

Looks for diagonals
	- Discontinous diagnols indicate gaps in seq1 or seq2

Which aligment we want?
	The best one:
		- evolutionary criteria: the one with the most residues
		- functional criteria: the one that aligns most functionally similar regions

Which alignment we get?
	The one with the best score

Scoring systems
	naive one: matches
	penalize gaps
		- creation
		- elongation

You can create different scoring systems

The score of an alignment depends on the scoring system

Alignment algorithm 1:
	- Calculate scores for all posible alignments and get the best one

Needleman-Wunsh -> global
	- Dinamic programming
	- They guarantee highest scoring alignment
	- Much faster than exploring everything

Smith and Waterman:
	- Local: It explores alignments that do not cover all the sequence
	- It will create global alignments if they have the best score
	- Problem: local computationally more demanding

They can create other alignments, not best one

Result depends on the scoring schema

-> DNA sequence alignment example with matcher. Reverse.

-> Example with homologous proteins


AMINOACID SUBSTITUTION MATRICES

it would be nice to score aminoacid changes according to
	chemically similar

How do we do the scoring matrices?

We can quantify frequency of homologous positions in different proteins

PAMXX
	homologous proteins
	multiple alinment
	XX number of mutations per 100 positions

Difference between mutations occurred and changes observed

BLOSUMXX
	Only conserved block
	Easier for distant proteins
	Recomended for looking for blocks
	XX Minimum percent of identity allowed

The same idea could be applied for DNA.
	Not same probability of mutation between different nucleotide pairs

STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE

Easy to get an intuitive idea for two DNA sequences
Difficult for protein

Difficult for many sequences

Calculate some statistic
	to be continued in blast...
