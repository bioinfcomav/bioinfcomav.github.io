We have to annotate the sequences:
	structural: promoter, exons, introns, CDS, transposons
	functional.

From evidences (e.g. ESTs) we annotate

Different degrees of support
	- like in a crime investigation (bird killed by a cat: blood in floor, corpse without head, happy cat cleaning itself, blood stains in cat)
	- ORFs, similar proteins in database, ESTs, etc.

RESTRICTION MAP

physical map with restriction sites

Very useful for cloning

Rebase: database with sites

With a restriction site sequence we can do the map

Small sequences are all over the place at random
	prob depends on length and nucleotide composition


TRANSLATING DNA

Genetic code almost universal

Six possible frames

BACKTRANSLATION

Not possible without uncertainty


ORF

a strech of reading frame with no stop codon. Usually starts with AUG

ORFs can be random, specially if short

CDS PREDICTION

Which ORF is the CDS?

Longer ORF is the CDS?

Problems:
	- introns
	- start codon outside available sequence
	- sequencing error:
		stop
		frame shift

CODON USAGE TABLE

codon usage bias.
	Not all synonymous codons are used with the same frequency

codon usage table vary between different species

The ORF that corresponds with the real CDS should use the typical codon of the species

PROTEIN CONSERVATION

Using Blast using the six translated frames with a protein database

INTRONS

codon acceptor and donor sites

ESTs

GENE STRUCTURE PREDICTION

Evidences:
	ORFs
	codon usage bias
	splice sites
	ESTs
	protein conservation

Limitations of ESTs:
	low expressed gene
	mRNAs not completely covered. 5' UTR
	infering isoforms is not easy
	spurios ESTS from: non-mature mRNA, intergenic regions

Limitations of protein conservation:
	No similarity in database
	pseudogenes

NON CODING REGIONS AND GENES ARE PROBLEMATIC

e.g. antisense genes

No ORF, no protein database similarity

ESTs are the main evidence

5' UTRs are problematic
	due to cDNA library construction

EVIDENCE AND CONFIDENCE

No evidence is ironclad, they increase or decrease the probability

An annotation for a gene is a model:
	- We'll be more confident of genes with more evidences
	- The real real gene is more complex (This is not a pipe)
	- The model should be similar to the reality to be useful, but the map is not the territory


PROMOTER PREDICTION

Bacteria: Pribnow box
	consensus TATAAT -10

Archea and eucariots:
	TAT box: TATAAA -20 to -35
	CCAAT box GGCCAATCT -60 to -100
	GC box GGGCGG -110

Transcription factor sites
	different for each transcription factor
	usually small
	variable
	Each gene will have different transcription factor sites

DESCRIBING VARIABLE MOTIFS

Consensus
	They miss the variation

Sequence patters with all possibilities like: TATAA(A/T) TATAAW
	They miss the frequencies

Possition specific scoring matrices
