INTRODUCTION
Uses:
	phylogeny
	conserved domains in proteins
	conserved regions in promoters

SW not possible.
	Multidimensional matrix
	grows exponentially

Assumes:
	Sequences are homologues
	Alignment is global
	Not very long insertions or deletions
		depends on gap extension penalty

Not suitable for assemblies

ALGORITHM

Progressive construction:
	It is easier to align two similar sequences
	They look for similar sequences and they align those first

How do we look for similar sequences?
	i.e. scores
How do we look for similar sequences in an hieralchical way?
	Score pair matrix
	hierachical clustering (guide tree)
	multiple alignment

FIGURE algorithm

Multiple alignment software has alorithms to align:
	- sequence to sequence
	- sequence to alignment
	- alignment to alignment

clustalw implements this algorithm

LIMITATIONS

We don't have a guarantee of the highest score

In clustalW errors introduced are not revised

FIGURE fat cat problem

ClustalW is not recommened anymore

OPTION 1: AVOID ERRORS

T-coffee considers extra information to avoid errors:
	- pairwise alignmetns
	- other alignments
	- domains
	- secondary structure

T-coffee is slow with many sequences

OPTION 2: REVISE

Iterative algorithms revise the growing multiple alignment in each step

Example MAFFT. Recommended for DNA

OPTION 3: HMM

Most advanced.

Clustal Omega.
	Hidden Markov models
	Recommended for protein.
	Fast

Why do we not explain algorithm
We explain when:
	- is very used BLAST
	- is very general BLAST word or e-value hypothesis
	- Algorithm is easy to understand

ALIGNMENT EVALUATION

check regions with many changes
Can be done automatically with trimal
