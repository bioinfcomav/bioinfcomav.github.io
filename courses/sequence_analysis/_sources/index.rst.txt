 
NGS sequence analysis
=====================

The course deals with the analysis from NGS reads.
The main topics are:

  * read quality control,
  * read cleaning,
  * assembly,
  * mapping,
  * SNP calling,

The lessons will be mostly practical with some theoretical introduction. Several exercises will be proposed to introduce to the students in a gradual way to the field.
All software used in the course will be free software freely available in the web.

Despite that a small introduction to unix console usage is included in this course, could be interesting to the students  to practice  with the basic commands before. There are several interesting courses on line, such as:

`Informática para las ciencias de la vida: Unix y Python <http://bioinf.comav.upv.es/courses/linux/index.html>`_

`Unix Tutorial for Beginners <http://www.open-of-course.org/courses/course/view.php?id=45>`_


Although some topics related with the analysis of RNA samples, the quantification of the RNA expression will not be covered in this course. 

Professors: Joaquín Cañizares Sales, Jose Blanca, Peio Ziarsolo
