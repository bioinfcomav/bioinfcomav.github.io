    "text": "Rationale\nThere are plenty of programing languages, but all of them share some common principles. Computers execute machine code, a binary set of instructions that are carried out by the computer processors, but usually human do not write binary machine code, or even assembly language, the written code directly translatable to machine code.\nMost of the time programers write code in languages that are easier to write and read by us, humans. These codes, in turn, have to be translated to machine code. This process of translation is called compilation. Compilation is a complex process that comprises several steps, and different compilers and programming languages divide theses steps differently. There are compilers, like the C or C++ compiles, that take the code and compile it into a binary executable that can be directly run in a computer, while there are other, like the Python interpreter of the Java compiler, that are capable of running directly the human readable code that create an intermediate representation called bytecode. In these cases we need to install the language interpreter to run the program. For instance, if you want to run a Java or Python program you will need to install Java or Python before.\nPython is an interpreted language, so, once you install Python you will be able to directly run Python code. However, you first need to have Python available in your computer.\nThere are many ways of installing Python like:\n\nDownloading Python from python.org.\nUsing the Windows store or the Linux packages already prepared.\nUsing a Python version manager like uv.\nHaving Python included in your web browser thanks to Pyodide.\n\nIn this exercise we are going to use JupyterLite, a version of the Jupyter, a system that allows to write and run Python code directly in a web page, that does not require any previous installation because it already includes Python, thanks to Pyodide.\nThe Notebook document is composed by cells, some are text (in markdown format), and others contain Python code that can be executed. To execute a Python cell:\n\nSelect the cell that you want to execute.\nClick the play symbol on top of the page or press shift + enter.",

Remember that there are inmutable objects, like str, int or float, and mutable objects, like list. A list is mutable because we can change its members after we have created it, but a text string is inmutable because once we have created we can not modify it (although be could derive other strings for it).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use a mutable object as a default parameter in a function definition, you will get into trouble.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem is that the default values for the arguments are created when the function is defined, so just once. Thus, in this example there is only one default empty list for all function calls to the create_guest_list function. Every time that we get the default list we are getting the same empty list. This would not be a problem if the object wasn’t mutable, but it is a huge problem with mutable objects. So the pattern that Python programmers use to avoid this problem is the following, setting the default value to None and creating the list, if needed, inside the function. In this way one different default empty list is created for each function call, not like before that only was created when the function was built.",

As we have seen we refer to the data stored in memory by using variables. We could think that those variables, once they are created, are available in every part of our program. Some programming languages used that approach, but when you try to build a program with more than a few lines of code it becomes very difficult to track which part of the program has changed a variable. So maintining those large programs is very difficult.\nMost programming languages use the concept of the scope. The scope defines where in the code a variable is available, and functions define their own scope. For instance, if we declare a variable inside a function it won’t be available outside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe get a “‘name’ is not defined error” because the variable name was created inside the say_hello function, so in the say_hello scope, and is not available outside. A variable can only be used inside its scope.\nBe careful because Python has a global scope, and if you create the variable outside the function it will be available inside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case the variable name has been created in the global scope, is a global variable available everywhere. In general avoid creating global variables, specially if they are just inmutable constants. If you think you need a global variable, think twice, in most cases is better not to use them. This is an advance topic, but here’s a tip for the future you, to keep states it might be much better to use objects, instances of a class, that global variables. But this is a too advance topic for now. Just remember, try very hard not to use global varibles, although you can do some exceptions with some inmutable ones use just for global configurations.",

Again, like in the parameters passed to the function, the caller will receive a new reference to the value stored in memory that can assign to a new variable. return is use to move a result in memory between scopes. For instance, in the previous example there is a variable, inside the function, named area, but in the first call we store the reference in a variable named result. area and result are two variables, two references to the same value stored in memory, but they are variables that belong to different scopes. In this case area belongs to the scope of the calc_rect_area function and result to the global scope.\nNote also that each time that the function returns its scope is erased, so each call will be independent. Imagine that we want to store the number of times that a function has been called. Could you modify the following function to accomplish that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most natural way to store states is to use instances of classes (objects), but this is an advance topic that we won’t discuss now.\nFunctions can return multiple results, we just need to separate them with commas.

What would be the result of executing the following code and why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nEverytime we call a function a new scope with new data is created and the function starts its execution in its first line and ends its execution once it encounters the first return. That’s why no matter how many time we call this function it will always return “Hi” and “Bye” will be never reached.\n\n\n\n\nWrite a function that returns “odd” or “even” depending on the number that we pass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip",

You can think about the memory of a computer as a file cabinet in which we can store values like numbers and strings of letters.

So, for instance, we could tell the computer to store the number 42 in the address 00000100, but it would be very cumbersome to use these numeric addresses, so, instead, the we use variables, names that we create, to refer to the memory locations and contents.\nIn different programming languages and expressions a variable can refer to the value stored or to the memory address (pointer).
