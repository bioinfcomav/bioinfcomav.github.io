    "text": "Rationale\nThere are plenty of programing languages, but all of them share some common principles. Computers execute machine code, a binary set of instructions that are carried out by the computer processors, but usually human do not write binary machine code, or even assembly language, the written code directly translatable to machine code.\nMost of the time programers write code in languages that are easier to write and read by us, humans. These codes, in turn, have to be translated to machine code. This process of translation is called compilation. Compilation is a complex process that comprises several steps, and different compilers and programming languages divide theses steps differently. There are compilers, like the C or C++ compiles, that take the code and compile it into a binary executable that can be directly run in a computer, while there are other, like the Python interpreter of the Java compiler, that are capable of running directly the human readable code that create an intermediate representation called bytecode. In these cases we need to install the language interpreter to run the program. For instance, if you want to run a Java or Python program you will need to install Java or Python before.\nPython is an interpreted language, so, once you install Python you will be able to directly run Python code. However, you first need to have Python available in your computer.\nThere are many ways of installing Python like:\n\nDownloading Python from python.org.\nUsing the Windows store or the Linux packages already prepared.\nUsing a Python version manager like uv.\nHaving Python included in your web browser thanks to Pyodide.\n\nIn this exercise we are going to use Pyodide, a Python version that allow us to run Python code directly in a web page without requiring any previous installation.\nThe Notebook document is composed by cells, some are text (in markdown format), and others contain Python code that can be executed. To execute a Python cell:\n\nSelect the cell that you want to execute.\nClick the play symbol on top of the page or press shift + enter.",

They are mappings, they assing a key to every value, and we use those keys to access to the values.

If you study a different programming language you will need to understand if the variables are ment to be values, pointers or references. In Python they are always references. You can read a Real Python tutorial about Python references.\nIn Python every variable is a reference, and arguments to functions are thus passed by reference. When we pass a text string or a list to a function Python creates new references to these objects. We have to be careful because if you pass a mutable object to a function the function might changed it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging inside the function a mutable object that have been passed to it without warning the function user is a common source of bugs and problems. This is not a good practice, try to avoid it! The previous code could be written to avoid this problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault mutable arguments\nWhen you create your own functions with default parameters you have to be careful because there is a gotcha. Remember that there are inmutable objects, like str, int or float, and mutable objects, like lists. A list is mutable because we can change its items after we have created it, but a text string is inmutable because once we have created we can not modify it (although be could derive other strings for it).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use a mutable object as a default parameter in a function definition, you will get into trouble.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problem is that the default values for the arguments are created when the function is defined, so just once. Thus, in this example there is only one default empty list for all function calls to the create_guest_list function. Every time that we get the default list we are getting the same empty list. This would not be a problem if the object wasn’t mutable, but it is a huge problem with mutable objects. So the pattern that Python programmers use to avoid this problem is the following: setting the default value to None and creating the list, if needed, inside the function. In this way one different default empty list is created for each function call, not like before that only one was created when the function was defined.",

Once download it, we could open it using the following code.\n\nfile_name = \"11.txt.utf-8\"\nfile = open(file_name, 'rt')\n\nThe open function can take several parameters, but the most important ones are the file path and the mode.\nThe mode indicates if we are trying to open an existing file for reading (r mode) or creating a new file for writing (w mode). Moreover, it indicates if we are dealing with a text or [binary] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file) f*ile. In this example the mode was “rt”, so we are trying to open an existing text file for reading.\nIn this case, the open function returns to us a Text IO file object that allows us to read the file.\n\nRead text\nNow that we know how to open a file, let’s try to read it.

We could think that every time that we use the write method Python writes the given contents in disk, but this is not so. In fact what the write method does is to write the given content in a memory buffer. It writes in memory because memory is much faster than disk, and thus iIt would be very slow to write down in disk every time. When does Python decides to really write down in disk? Well, from time to time, but usually we do not take care of that. What we know for sure is that Python writes down everything that is to write when whe close the file calling the close method. So, close the file.\nIf you need to make sure that Python writes down to disk everything you have written so far you could also use the flush method, but don’t do it every time that you write, because that would be very slow.",

Programming languages are usually quite limited in what they can directly do, but they are expanded by adding preprogrammed functionality. Moreover, if would be very inefficient to program the same functionallity over and over again, for instance, to create the same parsing or statistical functions in every program that you need. Thus programming languages have ways of not repeating yourself.\nIn Python it is very easy to create a piece of code, like a function, in one file and using it in another. Let’s create a file called greeting.py that implements the following function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, in the same directory we are going to create a new program that will use this function. Let’s create the file hello.py with the following code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you run hello.py the first line imports the function print_hello from greeting.py and the function is ready to run.

The most popular tool is pip and this is the tool that I have used the most, but I have recently switched to uv.\nPython packages are collected in the pypi repository. Both pip and uv, by default, grab from pypi then packages that you want to install. The Python ecosystem, the amount of functionallity available is huge and no course can describe all the packages available (more than half a million). The best way to find out which are the most relevant packages for your needs are reading about the kind of problems that you want to solve and interacting with the community that works on them.\nBefore installing packages I highly recommend to read about virual environments.

    "text": "Scopes and arguments\nThe code inside a function has its own variables, and those are not shared between functions and between the function and the rest of the code. To use a value inside a value, usually, we pass the variable to the function. To understand what do we mean when we say that we pass some data to a function we need to understand the concept of the scope.\nWhen we are programming we store and access data in memory. As we have seen, we refer to the data stored in memory by using variables. We could think that those variables, once they are created, are available in every part of our program. If you used that approach when you tried to build a program with more than a few lines of code, it would become very difficult to track which part of the program had changed a variable. So maintining those large programs would be very difficult.\nThe scope defines where in the code a variable is available, and functions define their own scope. In a computer program not all data is available to every part of the code. For instance, the variables that are defined inside a function are not available outside of the function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe say that the variables defined in the function are in the function scope, that means that they are not available ouside of the function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe get a “‘name’ is not defined error” because the variable name was created inside the say_hello function, so in the say_hello scope, and is not available outside. A variable can only be used when is in the current scope. It is said that the function has a local scope in which its variables are available.\nSchema with the scope of a function call:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph def[\"def calc_area(width, height):\"]\n        subgraph func_scope[\"Function scope\"]\n            subgraph return\n               ret[\"return area\"]\n            end\n            subgraph in[\"function variables\"]\n               var[\"area = width * height\"]\n            end\n            subgraph arguments\n               width\n               height\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    subgraph result[\"result = calc_area(2, 3)\"]\n        subgraph caller[\"Caller scope\"]\n            subgraph result_[\" \"]\n               result__[\"result =\"]\n            end\n            subgraph funccall[\"Function call\"]\n               call1[\"calc_area(2, 3)\"]\n            end\n        end\n    end\n    return ---&gt; result__\n    call1 ---&gt; arguments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal scope\nBe careful because Python also has a global scope, and if you create the variable outside the function it will be available inside. We can use the variables defined in the global scope inside any function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case the variable name has been created in the global scope, it is a global variable available everywhere. In general, avoid creating global variables, specially if they are not inmutable constants. As a general rule the use of the global scope is discouraged, try not to use it. If you think you need a global variable, think twice, in most cases is better not to use them. This is an advanced topic, but here’s a tip for the future you, to keep states it might be much better to use objects, instances of a class, that global variables. For now, this is too advanced. Just remember, try very hard not to use global varibles, although you can allow some exceptions with some inmutable ones used for global configurations. It is common to use this kind of global variables, inmutables and related to configuration, and, by convention, in Python, people name them using all caps variable names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython discourages some uses of the use the global scope, and the behaviour of these variables is atypical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassing data to a function, function arguments\nSo, when the function requires some data to carry an action, we should pass that data explictly to the function. For instance, if we want a function to print a personalized greeting, it could need the name of the person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassing data to a function is easy, but a lot is going on under the hood:\n\nWe have created a text string (“Jane”). That means that Python has created and stored a object of type str in memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n    subgraph main [ ]\n    person:::invisible\n    end\n    subgraph say [ ]\n    name:::invisible\n    end\n    Memory:::memory\n    subgraph Memory\n    Jane[\"'Jane'\"]\n    end\n    person --&gt; Jane\n    name --&gt; Jane\n    classDef variable fill:#f96\n    classDef invisible opacity:0%\n    classDef memory fill:#ccc\n    linkStyle 0,1 stroke-width:0px\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have assigned the variable person to that string, so now person refers to that str object stored in memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n    subgraph main [global scope]\n    person\n    end\n    subgraph say [ ]\n    name:::invisible\n    end\n    Memory:::memory\n    subgraph Memory\n    Jane[\"'Jane'\"]:::variable\n    end\n    person --&gt; Jane\n    name --&gt; Jane\n    classDef invisible opacity:0%\n    classDef memory fill:#ccc\n    linkStyle 1 stroke-width:0px\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we call the function we pass the reference of the object, the variable person, to the function.\nThe function receives the reference to the str object and assigns to it a new reference, in this case called name. It is very important to understand that although the object is the same, the “Jane” string, we have created a new reference to it, the new variable name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n    subgraph main [global scope]\n    person\n    end\n    subgraph say [say_hello scope]\n    name\n    end\n    Memory:::memory\n    subgraph Memory\n    Jane[\"'Jane'\"]\n    end\n    person --&gt; Jane\n    name --&gt; Jane\n    classDef invisible opacity:0%\n    classDef memory fill:#ccc",

Again, like in the arguments passed to the function, the caller will receive a new reference to the value stored in memory that can assign to a new variable. return is used to move a result in memory between scopes. For instance, in the previous example there is a variable, inside the function, named area, but in the first call we store the reference in a variable named result. area and result are two variables, two references to the same value stored in memory, but they are variables that belong to different scopes.

And although we are not going to discuss this topic yet, it is important to understand the concept and use of methods, the object “functions”. In fact we have already used methods when dealing with strings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupper is a method, a function associated with an object. In this case the object is the string “hello” and upper is a function that acts on that object. By convention functions associated to objects are called methods. So upper is a method, a function associated to the objects of type str. You can think on a method like on a function that has as its first argument the given object. If upper were a standard function, the previous code would be:\ns = \"hello\"\ns = upper(s)\nprint(s)\nSomething similar to that would work if upper were a normal function but, instead, upper is a method associated to an object, so the syntax is different, we use a dot after the object, then the name of the method/function, and then the language makes sure that the object is passed as the first argument to this method.\nIf you want to understand Python you need to learn about objects, classes, methods and properties, because Python is a deeply object-oriented language, but this is a topic that we can leave for later.",

In the string case we will get a string with several characters. To get them we use the colon (:) to separate the first and the last position. Take into account that the first position will be included in the selection but the last one will be not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredict the result of running the following code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe combination of the start and end position is called slice. By using this kind of indexing we are slicing the string. Slices can also be built using the slice built-in function, but this is a more avanced topic.\nSlices, besides start and stop, allow for a third number, the step, that indicates the increment between the index of the selected items. For instance, we could use the step to select every three characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep is commonly used to reverse the string by using a step of -1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way of reversing a string, or any Python sequence, is to use the reversed function. The result won’t be exactly the same because reversed returns an iterator that has to be converted into a string. The reversed function could seem more cumbersome, but iterators have many advantages in different contexts. But we won’t discuss them here because this is a more advanced topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcercise, create a way of checking if a string is a palindrome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could check if the reversed string is equal to the original string.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a program that given a number prints its digits in reverse order and separated by spaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother useful string method is find.

You can think about the memory of a computer as a file cabinet in which we can store values like numbers and strings of letters. Internally the memory is divided in small pieces, like the drawers of a filing cabinet, and the computer assings a numeric adress to each of those drawers. So, for instance, we could tell the computer to store the number 42 in the address 00000100, but it would be very cumbersome to use these numeric addresses, so, instead, the we use variables, names that we create, to refer to the memory locations and contents.\nIn different programming languages a variable can refer to the value stored or to the memory address (pointer). In Python a variable will always be a reference to the object stored. You can think of it as a label in the file cabinet drawer or an arrow that points to the drawer.\n\n\n\nValue stored in a variable\n\n\nIn Python we store a variable in memory by using the assigment operator =.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython is doing quite a lot of things for us when we write “favorite_number = 42”:\n\nIt reserves a space in the memory to be able to store the object that is going to create.\nIt creates the object 42.\nIt assigns the favorite_number variable as a reference to the created and stored object.",
