Population genetic practices
============================

One locus
---------

.. grid:: 2

      Balancing selection with differing selection preasures in different populations


One genomic region
------------------

.. grid:: 2

   .. grid-item-card:: Bottleneck
      :link: practices/coalescence/bottleneck.html

      Bottleneck impact on diversity

   .. grid-item-card:: Founder effect
      :link: practices/coalescence/founder.html

      Drift due to the founder effect

   .. grid-item-card:: Drifting pops.
      :link: practices/coalescence/drifting_pops.html

      Three pops. drifting from one ancestral pop.

   .. grid-item-card:: Admixture
