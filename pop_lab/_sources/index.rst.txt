Population genetics simulations for the classroom.

Simulation applications
=======================

One locus forward in time
-------------------------

These applications simulate the classic one locus with two alleles scenario in one or more populations.
They can be used to explore: drift, selection, mutation, migration and selfing.
For more details use the applications or read their :doc:`documentation <practices/fwd/one_locus>`.

   .. grid-item-card:: Balancing selection
      :link: balancing_selection

   .. grid-item-card:: One locus general

Coalescence
-----------

The following set of applications simulate the evolution of a genomic region, with mutation, drift, recombination and selection, in different demographic scenarios using a coalescence approach.
