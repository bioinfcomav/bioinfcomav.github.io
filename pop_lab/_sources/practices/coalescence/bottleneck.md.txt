# Bottleneck

A population bottleneck is a shrap reduction in the number of individuals, the population size, during some time.
It could be caused, for instance, by an environmental factor, like a drought or a viral disease.

In this practice we are going to analyze the bottleneck effect in genetic diversity.

[Bottleneck simulation application](<http:../../bottleneck/>)

## Bottlenecks and diversity

Imagine that our population goes through a bottleneck. What do you think will be the effect on:

- Expected heterozygosity
- Number of variants
- Number and rate of polymorphic variants

Do the simulation and compare your expectations with the result of the simulation.
Remember that you can get the values of these parameters before, during and after the bottleneck in the different plots and tables.

Does the expected heterozygosity, number of variants and number of polymorphic (95%) variants recover its initial value after the bottleneck is over?

How does the bottleneck affect the Allele Frequency Spectrum? (Compare the oldest sample of the population and the most recent one (0))

Could you explain the effect of the bottleneck in the ratio of polymorphic (95%) variants?

## Effect of the population size and time after the bottleneck

Does increasing the number of individuals, population size, after the bottleneck improve the bottleneck recovery? Why? Which is the evolutive force that, eventually, would drive this recovery?

Does increasing the time since the bottleneck manages to overcome the drop in diversity?

## Effect of the bottleneck strength

How does the number of individuals, population size, during the bottleneck and the bottleneck duration affect all the diversity parameters?
Is there a number of individuals that make the bottleneck almost irrelevant?

## Real population consequences

How do you think that these result inform the management of real populations, like an endangered species that recovers a big population size or a breeding population created from a handful of selected individuals?

Which actions would you propose to recover the diversity on these populations that have suffered a bottleneck?
