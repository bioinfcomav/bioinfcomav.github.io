# Founder effect

When a new population is founded it is quite common that just a few members of an older original population create the new population.
This causes a bottleneck that has an impact in the diversity of the new population and the genetic distance with the original populations.

This is a common phenomenon that happens, for instance, when few individuals colonize a new island or territory or are used to create a new breed.

## Effect on diversity

How do you think that the following parameters will change in the new population:

- Expected heterozygosity
- Total number of markers
- Number of polymorphic markers

Do this parameter recover after the new population increases its size?

## Genetic distances

The new population ends up having some genetic distance when compared with the original population.
When do you think that the bulk of this distance will appear?
Once the population are differentiated, do you think that will became closer again shortening its distances?
Run the simulation and check the genetic distance matrix.

## Bottleneck strength

How do you think the number of founder individuals and the number of generations with a smaller population size will influence the diversity and genetic distances?

Run the simulation with different number of individuals and bottleneck lengths and analyze the result.
