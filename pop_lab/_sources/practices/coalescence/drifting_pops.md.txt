# Drifting populations

Imagine that we have three populations that, originally, are created from the same ancestral population and that, once created, they evolve independently with time.
Let's think about what genetic drift would do to those populations.

[Drifting populations simulation application](<https:bioinf.comav.upv.es/pop_lab/drifting_pops/>)

## Genetic distances

What do you think that will happen with the genetic distances of those population with time?
Run the simulation, analyze and explain the result.

Think about what do you expect to see in the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) also.

## Population size influence

What would happen if you increase the size of all populations up to 2000 individuals?
Would the distances will be bigger, smaller or similar?

Do you expect the the PCA to be different? Run the simulation and explain the result

Now repeat the experiment with two big populations of 2000 individuals and one of 100.
Which would be the behaviour of the small population compared with the larger ones?
