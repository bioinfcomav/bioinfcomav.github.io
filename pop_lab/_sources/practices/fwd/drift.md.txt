# Drift practice

We are simulating one locus with two alleles.

1. First simulate the frecuency variation along the time in a big population (1000 individuals) and 100 generations. 

    · The  genotypic graphic is that you expected? 

    · Will be the result similar if you run again the simulation? Why?

2. Reduce the population size to 100 and run the similation 10 times. Save the genotypic frecuences obtained in each simulation.

    · How times the allele A is fixed or lost?

3. Increased the number of generation to 500 and repeat the 10 simulations.

    · The results are similars to a 100 generations?

4. What happened if the frequence of A will be 0.8? Simulate 10 times with a small and a big population.

    · Compare and explain the results. 

5. Locking the Freq A graphic, could you predict the behavior of the expected heterozygosity graphics?.

    · Test it several times with a small population and diferent A frequencies.

6. A population of a special variety of plant with a rare allele in the rest of populations has 1000 individuals. But a route will be constucted in the population site, What could be the minimum population size that have to remain to mantain the allele if the initial frequence of the 'a' alleles is 0.2?
