# Drift

## Introduction

In this practice, we will simulate the evolution of a locus with two alleles (A and a).
You will be able to modify the initial allelic frequency of A and the number of generations.
We will assume that genotypic frequencies follow Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

In this simulations, there are no mutation or selectionâ€”just a population of a given size evolving generation after generation through random mating.
Finally, you can choose to run one or multiple simulations simultaneously.

## Randomness

What do you think will happen if a population with an initial A allelic frequency of 0.5 and 100 individuals evolves over 100 generations?
Does evolution always follow the same pattern when you run the simulation multiple times? Why or why not?

## Fixation

Evolve a population of 100 individuals over 100 generations.
Run the simulation 20 times and count how many times an allele becomes fixed.

What happens if, instead of 100 generations, the population evolves for 300 generations?
What do you think would eventually happen if we ran the simulation for thousands of generations?

When fixation occurs, is one allele more likely to be fixed than another?
Change the initial A allelic frequency to 0.9 and compare the results with the 0.5 case.

What usually happens to alleles at very low frequencies in the population?
Could an allele with a low initial frequency increase its frequency over time?

Imagine that you have a population of an endangered species.
There is one locus, responsible for a color variation, with an allele frequency for the minor allele of 0.1.
Due to a degradation of its environment its population size is reduced to 200 individuals, after 50 generations, which would be the chances of having preserved that phenotypic variation?

## Population Size Influence

How does the number of individuals affect the differences between evolutionary outcomes?
Do the differences between trials increase or decrease with changes in population size?

How does population size influence the likelihood of fixation?
Run simulations with populations of 200 individuals for 100 generations and compare the results with those for 100 and for 50 individuals.

What happens if we assume, as in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, that the population is infinite?

## Drift and Diversity

Now that you have explored allelic frequency behavior, can you predict how expected heterozygosity changes over time?

If we start with an A allelic frequency of 0.5, can the expected heterozygosity increase?
Can genetic drift increase diversity?
What would eventually happen to diversity if we ran the simulation for many generations?

If we started with an A allelic frequency of 1, could drift alone generate diversity?
