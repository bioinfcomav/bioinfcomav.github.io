Databases
=========

Some of the databases that the group have designed and created.

Melonomics

Melogene
________
New genomic tools for Melon (Cucumis melo) breeding: transcriptome, SSR, SNP collections and high throughput genotyping platforms.
`Melogene site <https://melogene.upv.es>`_


Cucurbigene
___________
New genomic tools for Squash (Cucurbita spp.) breeding: transcriptome, genetic map, SNP collections and high throughput genotyping platforms applied to the competitive development of new cultivars, with improve fruit quality and disease resistance.
